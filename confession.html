                        &emsp; I don't know where to start hahaha I've been keeping this for how many months(not sure if you already know this).. you always make my day happy, when I'm always down or sad i just look at your smile and your laugh and all my problems are gone. Every time i think of you, you make my stomach squeasy. You're always in my dreams not sure how many times but consecutive you're always in it, You always make my start of the day exciting.

                        &emsp;  Here it is.... I really really like you KC! From the bottom of my heart. I never feel this way to anyone but you. No matter what you answer, I just wanted you to know how special you are to me. You filled my heart with this joy that I didn't know it will happen to me again, I'm very grateful. But if you say Yes, I promise you that i will always make you smile and always cherish you and always here for you and tell you how much you mean to me. <3
